My name is Dmitri and Ive been in a hobby for about two years, started with a 14gal biocube some basic soft corals a pair of clown fish and a goby. I quickly upgraded to more and bigger tanks (60gal,120gal to 155gal) needless to say, I was well hooked into this hobby.",
    "Six months into it Ive upgraded to RSM 650S all in one system. That tank was a pure joy, fantastic great size and superior quality. Looking forward year and a half, I had a system of 500 gallons mixed reef with great success in keeping both fish and sps / lps corals.",
"In late April of 2018, I’ve started to feel dissatisfied and needed to make major changes. I was thinking of going even bigger, this time I didn’t want to have so many tank. My vision was to have one large 1000 – 2000 gal display tank with a fish room. And so I started doing research and getting ideas what it will take to get this done.",
"First I needed to find big enough house and at the same time quickly sell my tanks with live stock. Moving to the new house with all live stock wasn’t an option. I had big help from our local reef club, several members help me hold my fish and corals during my moving stages.",
"During my search for the house, I was also getting quotes from all major manufacturers for this new tank I had envisioned. My original plan was to purchase tank after I get settled in the new house 6-12 months. However, opportunity came and I was very fortunate to have purchase tank from a local member along with most of his major filtration system. This happened while I was still scouting for a new house. Finally in the middle of July we purchase a house and tank was ready to be moved.",
"1000 gallon display tank Dimensions: 130x59x31 Weight of the tank: 2500lbs. Custom made, euro bracing, low iron display with 1” glass all around. Double glass 2” on the bottom with plywood attached to it.",
"This is an image of the tank from original owner when it was first delivered to him.And so this journey begins."

For about two weeks we had multi companies coming and going to survey the site. We also had to hurry up because the owner sold his house and tank needed to be moved asap. By late June we went through several riggers with no luck / commitment to the job.","Finally, we have exhausted all resources and needed to make a decision on the company to take this task. We have reached out to Team MRC and Raj and his team came through! The move was set for July 17th! Here is a quick video of how the tank needed to be moved out of the owners house. 1000 gal moving strategy And here are some shots of new place unfinished basement."

Most of it I had to figure out myself by watching videos, etc. The company needs to put a bit more effort into making setup videos. The biggest challenge was that I had to exit out of the app during the initial setup, and after turning it back on, there was no way to get back into the step-by-step directions. My Reefbot was telling me that it was already registered to an account and would not let me do anything. After several tickets and a couple of days messing around with the unit, I finally figured out what needed to be done.","Having said that, I’m super happy with the automation that Reefbot brings. I’m thinking I may create a video on how to set up the unit and what things to look for during the process to help others out there. Currently, I’m testing nitrate, alkalinity, phosphates, and calcium with this unit.","Here is what I found out: the Hanna checker for alkalinity was giving me consistent results; however, it’s about 1.5 dKH off from the Red Sea tester. I’ve used three different Hanna testers with three different reagents and got similar results. Hanna checker would show me alkalinity at 8.2-8.8 dKH, while the Red Sea Pro would show me 9.8-10.3 dKH. I have ordered a Salifert test kit and am looking forward to comparing the results. For now, I’m focusing on stability. I’ve lowered the drip rate of the calcium reactor and am keeping my alkalinity at 9 dKH by the Red Sea Pro test kit.","Phosphates are between 0.02 - 0.04. I am still fine-tuning the dosing of lanthanum chloride. Also, with the stump remover, I’m doing about 3 tablespoons daily to raise nitrates to 10 ppm; currently, they are at 5 ppm.

I was raising nitrates in the tank, and now they are between 10-20 ppm.","The skimmer is about 5 feet away from where the spots of water were found.

Everything is looking incredible. I hope you get the leak figured out. If it's a real slow leak, salt creep should seal it in a week or so.","Couple of questions. How has the pH been, especially when the skimmer has been off? Is there a reason you're shooting for exactly 10 nitrates? I've always approached it as 10 was the max and anything between 2-10 was good, but 5 was the sweet spot.","Thanks, Adam! pH has been between 7.8 - 7.9. I've got a lot of surface agitation, which I think helps with keeping up pH. I also circulate fresh air from outside at nighttime. But when I run the skimmer, pH definitely goes higher. As far as nitrates go, I'm shooting for somewhere in the range of 10 to 15. I've been having a lot more success with growth and coloration when it's higher. I've also noticed algae isn't as much of an issue (hair algae) when keeping nitrates higher. Another reason is when I'm looking for a ratio between phosphates and nitrates to be about 1 to 17. Having higher phosphates, it seems easier to increase nitrates rather than battling phosphates to keep them at a lower level. It's all constant trial and error, one giant experiment figuring out what works best.","myaquariumpro said:","Thanks, Adam! pH has been between 7.8 - 7.9.

With the skimmer running 24/7 and a CO2 scrubber connected in a closed loop, the pH would be what you're seeing.

Currently, I'm running the skimmer just during nighttime hours, which helps with balancing pH a bit more. My main concern is to get nitrates to be around the 10-15 ppm area because of phosphate issues.","As for the uglies, that was one of the main issues so far—not getting nitrates high fast enough while phosphates were out of balance. So, I had a hair algae issue in my frag tank and lost a few frags to that. No issues in the main tank. Feeding heavily, and corals are growing well. There was a pump issue during the backup generator installation. One of the return pumps gave out, but luckily, I had a spare one and replaced it. I'm looking to upgrade both Dolphin pumps to new MRC pumps, which would save me around 300 kWh of energy.","I did get a few new corals: some high-end Acros, a couple of sweet chalices, and a gold 22-tail Indo torch.

You'd need several with a tank your size. Also, if a coral is not secured good, they will knock it over.

I checked the sump and saw that everything was working flawlessly, so it couldn’t be a lack of water.

I adjusted the valve, and water started flowing into the reactor. I also noticed that the water valve from the reactor wasn’t letting water out, so I opened it too.

Another shocker. Where did the water go? I took out the inline check valve and started blowing air into it to test it, and sure enough, it was going in from both sides.

If I had let it go for a couple of days without noticing, the alkalinity would probably have dropped significantly, potentially crashing the tank. Also, the calcium pump would have burned out running on empty. I think I will have to replace the pH probe in the reactor, but overall, a near disaster was avoided!","What are the odds of a calcium reactor and kalkwasser reactor failure on the same day?

    content: ["For the last couple of months, I’ve been battling phosphate issues and forgot about nitrates. My nitrates were always between 10-20, so I stopped testing for about a month. With all the algae issues I was having, I assumed it was definitely phosphates. Stupid assumptions and no testing cost me dearly. Four days ago, I decided to test out this new Hannah nitrates kit. Prior to this test, I was using the reefbot for nitrates with the Red Sea kit. Results would come in at 20ppm, and I didn’t think much of it. Anyways, I did the Hannah nitrates test and it came out over 50ppm. So I tested two more times thinking it was an error. Same result... At this point, I realized that this was the main issue why a lot of my corals were browning out.","First thing I did was a massive water change. Unfortunately, with a 1400-gallon system and only 200 gallons of premixed salt, water changes were limited. Over the next 48 hours, I did around 409 gallons of changes. While doing these water changes, I looked around to see what could possibly be the source of these nitrates and phosphates. After all, the skimmer is running wet and full power, additionally, I have a refugium, algae reactor, and a scrubber. I couldn’t figure it out. All my tanks are bare bottom. So while doing water changes in the refugium, I was doing some cleaning. On the bottom of the refugium (75-gallon tank) with very little flow, all detritus was settling over the last 17 months. I never cleaned it once... There was about a 1-inch thick layer of detritus. When I started vacuuming, it was clear to me that this was the source of all problems with phosphates and nitrates. It’s been about 24 hours since I vacuumed it.","In addition to water changes, I’ve set up another reactor, a sulfur reactor. I hope after this, nitrates will never be a problem again. I’ve been dosing vodka to combat nutrients also, and I’m on week 6 of doing so, up to 16.2ml per day. My tank has been running for almost 19 months now, and fighting nutrients has been the biggest challenge so far. One thing's for sure, with big systems, unless you have a huge amount of water on hand ready for emergency water changes, it’s very hard to flatten the curve. It’s like a freight train... In the near future, I’m planning to invest in a 600-700 gallon wall/water tank for emergency purposes. There's a little bit of vacuuming left to do here, this picture is after I vacuumed 1-inch thick of detritus from the refugium. Here is a picture of calcium/GFO and the newest addition, a sulfur reactor, that I could fit all together side by side. There isn’t much space left here. Here are some pictures of casualties. I do hope some of these colonies will recover. Most expensive corals seem to always die first... Currently, phosphates are at 0.06ppm, and nitrates last test was at 50ppm. I’ll be doing one more water change of 75 gallons to clean the refugium completely out, then test again."],

This will involve designing some interesting shelves mounted on the back of the tank. I need to figure out the logistics of this project. One of the main reasons for doing this, aside from the visual appeal of having 8-900lbs of rock floating, is to eliminate detritus and dead spots that collect it.","2. I'm considering adding a sand filter. I'm tired of dealing with filter socks. I plan to install a 1000-gallon barrel in the garage to store fresh water. I'll plumb it to the sand filter for periodic flushing and cleaning, similar to what they do with swimming pools. Once it's cleaned out, I'll reconnect it to the main filtration system of the tank. I'd appreciate any assistance or tips from someone experienced with this type of setup, especially those who have worked with public aquariums or swimming pools. ","I need to build and install an ATS. I've been borrowing one from a friend and love how it's working so far.","saltwaterwannabe said: ","Cheers, and I'm looking forward to more updates!"],

Now, I didn't think it was possible to do that, so I did not take precautionary steps like turning off one of the pumps and shutting part of the manifold off. Two main pumps mean it's about 8-10k gallons of water per hour pressure, so much splashing water comes out. I immediately turned off the main valve and shut off the pumps. Then, I cut off the pipe and capped, sealing the manifold part.","Anyways, in two years, I have never turned off the main part of the tank manifold, so all the water that was going to one side of the tank was redirected to the other side and everywhere else. After I finished sealing, I looked at my reactors, and both calcium reactors were leaking from all the water pressure. Fixing that was as big of a deal, but that's definitely the downside of having a manifold. When one thing is adjusted, everything has to be adjusted as well. I'm running my tank on one pump at the moment while the cap is curing overnight. Crazy, crazy plumbing. Glad I didn't get electrocuted with all that water splashing. The water pressure was almost as bad as this guy."],

Yesterday, I finished the first part and connected the main 1000-gallon barrel from the garage to the 200-gallon mixing station in the basement. There were lots of challenges running pipes and connecting them with tight spaces in between, mainly because 2” pipes are a pain in the butt. I actually had to redo the corner fitting and replace PVC pipe with flex PVC. I’ve also connected the main barrel to the drain just in case. It's a very tight space under the stairs. After doing that job, it was like doing an advanced yoga class. You should have seen me doing these flips and bending backward just to get in there... Yesterday, I tested water lines, no leaks. It takes about 16.5 minutes to fill up 170 gallons from upstairs. That was just a gravity test; up next, I’ll be testing it with a pump. What’s left to plumb is the next part, which will connect directly into the sump. Here is a happy selfie of the job done; don’t want to go back there again...","Adam:","2'' schedule 80 piping for RO water. You've probably spent more cash running those lines than I have in all of my plumbing. You probably added 6.5 of those minutes by running the water into the Tee instead of through the Tee.

My family couldn’t get me out of the house Qi a tank like that.","Thanks for tagging along! ","So I was on vacation for 5 days, out of town. I set up everything on cruise control with apex, or so I thought... 2nd day out, Monday evening we have power surge. My system tells me one of the Neptune energy bars went offline and then came back with no voltage to it. Of course, it happened to be the most critical energy bar. ATO connected to that, RO refill connected to that and I made a mistake to put both dosers from two calcium reactors also connected to that energy bar. Now I’ve been monitoring and calculating what would happen in the next 3 days and looks like my alkalinity is dropping at the rate of 0.5 dkh per day without calcium reactor dosing. It went from 9.5 dkh to about 7 dkh when I will be back home tonight. Currently at 7.8 dkh. I’m thinking of using buffer to get it up to 7.5 dkh when I get home and then reconnecting both calcium reactors with the same dosing as before. Additionally, I’m planning to do a small water change and increase alkalinity testing from 4 times per day to maybe 8 times until I find a good spot for drip rate with alk. My goal is to increase alk to about 8.5 over a 1-week period. Also, I’m removing kamoer pumps from apex and putting them on a battery backup power strip that’s always on. Another thing I’m going to add is secondary ATO as a fail-safe. Split ATOs between two different energy bars. One thing I don’t understand is how it failed, new energy bar. Maybe the fuse went off. I can still see it on my apex display; it just says zero voltage output. Looking at cameras, it seems that ATO hasn’t been working for about 3 days and water level dropped. Salinity went up to about 36-36.5 ppt. And RO Refill seems to be not working as well. The RO reservoir isn’t empty but not refilling either. All fish seem to be doing fine. Flying in tonight and should be home this evening.","ichthyoid said: ","I truly hope everything is okay, Dmitri! If you need anything or any help, please let us know. Safe travels. Thanks, @ichthyoid! I hope it will be okay; alk didn’t drop below 7 yet. From looks of it, consumption of alkalinity starting to slow down too. Little bit slower after it hit 8 dkh." ],

Lights come on from 12 pm to 12 am. At 11 am, it seems to be the lowest reading point; it goes up from there until anywhere from 4 pm to 6-7 pm (20 units). That’s when I would feed the fish heavily (4 nori sheets). ORP drops from that point about 20 units again to the lowest reading, which is usually at 8 pm. It goes up from there until the next morning at 9 am, where it peaks and drops to repeat the cycle. Overall, it looks like ORP would rise for about 15 hours (night time) and drop for about 3 hours, then rise for about 7-8 hours, then drop for about 1-2 hours. Typically, there is a 20-unit drop.","I’m not sure what it means exactly, but it seems that feeding is definitely consistent with the drop in the reading.

Any spot that is going to need glue has to be clean. It would be much easier to pull the sump out of service and get it outside for cleaning. If that we're done you might as well drive it over to MRC so it can be worked on in their shop where they have all the equipment and no travel time for their employee(s). If you bring it to them cleaned and dry I'd think it'd be the least expensive to fix. I have a 150-gallon stock trough you can use for a temp sump while that one is repaired. It's going to need to be out of service for a couple of days or more I'd think. Once the repair is done everything is going to need to be cured before you put water in it. We could meet up and swap the trough and my ATS too.","Ya, I don’t think moving the sump would be an option. I’m planning to use PVC pipe and hammer between baffles to space them out how it was. Once it’s in the original location, even if it leaks, I should be able to use socks again. If this works, I may even leave those pipes between baffles in that place for that extra support. Theoretically this should work. Also, luckily I had a 3” diameter PVC cylinder that is long enough to use as a force for PVC pipe, as I’m slowly pushing it in. Here is what I’m working with. I’ve decided to turn one pump off and let water fill up the sump so I don’t fight against all that water pressure. So far, I’ve got two pipes down on one side. Each side is about 8” wide, a little more, but I’m giving some buffer space. Had to make a whole bunch of cuts, may need some more. Well, I got it in one place now. Gonna have to figure out about these pipes, make some holes in them or something… Back In Business!","Adam said: ","I don't believe he's done it this way before and was testing a very large water change through the sump. So this may have been the 1st time he's had the whole sump empty since it was installed. I actually do something similar on my display system, but I do not fill it from the drain chamber. I fill in the center chamber as well, but my sump isn't even 2' tall. Draining it completely is about 130ish gallons. I have started just draining everything but the two drain chambers of the sump and it's real close to 100 gallons. This has me rethinking about how I do my changes. My fear with Dimitri's situation is that water will seep through the separated section at the wall and it's no longer a true weir. It may fill in with crap over time but I wouldn't drain it like that again even with the piping crossmembers he's put in. Hopefully @skriz will chime in and give his long term recommendation.","Ya, this was kind of careless of me pushing that much water so fast without giving it too much thought… sump is built to last! Quality for sure. Before this, I do remember it had a leak between those baffles. That probably was a weak point and gave out after 2 years. I filled up 300 gallons in 5 minutes, that water pressure from the 2” pipe and how fast it was pushing definitely was too much. Next time I’ll be filling it much slower. The sump is without warranty since I bought it second hand. I think if I drill a few holes in those pipes that support each wall, it will be good enough not to cause any problems with sulfur. The water flow in that area is pretty crazy so I doubt anything would build up inside those pipes other than sponges and feather dusters. Thanks for tagging along!"],
