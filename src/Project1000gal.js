        Location Dallas Nov 8, 2018 Hi Folks, I want to introduce myself first.
        My name is Dmitri and I’ve been in a hobby for about
        two years, started with a 14gal biocube some basic soft corals a pair of
        clown fish and a goby. I quickly upgraded to more and bigger tanks (60gal,120gal to 155gal) needless to say, I was well hooked into this hobby.
        <br />
        Six months into it I’ve upgraded to RSM 650S all in one system. That
        tank was a pure joy, fantastic great size and superior quality. Looking
        forward year and a half, I had a system of 500 gallons mixed reef with
        great success in keeping both fish and sps / lps corals. <br />
        <br />
        In late April of 2018, I’ve started to feel dissatisfied and needed to
        make major changes. I was thinking of going even bigger, this time I
        didn’t want to have so many tank. My vision was to have one large 1000 –
        2000 gal display tank with a fish room. And so I started doing research
        and getting ideas what it will take to get this done. <br />
        <br />
        First I needed to find big enough house and at the same time quickly
        sell my tanks with live stock. Moving to the new house with all live
        stock wasn’t an option. I had big help from our local reef club, several
        members help me hold my fish and corals during my moving stages. <br />
        <br />
        During my search for the house, I was also getting quotes from all major
        manufacturers for this new tank I had envisioned. My original plan was
        to purchase tank after I get settled in the new house 6-12 months.
        However, opportunity came and I was very fortunate to have purchase tank
        from a local member along with most of his major filtration system. This
        happened while I was still scouting for a new house. Finally in the
        middle of July we purchase a house and tank was ready to be moved.
        <br />
        1000 gallon display tank <br />
        Dimensions: 130x59x31 <br />
        Weight of the tank: 2500lbs <br />
        Custom made, euro bracing, low iron display with 1” glass all around.
        Double glass 2” on the bottom with plywood attached. <br />
        <br />
        <img id="Picture 1" src={page1_1} alt="stand" />
        <br />
        This is an image of the tank from original owner when it was first
        delivered to him. <br />
        <br />
        And so this journey begins.

        Dallas • Nov 8, 2018 • • #3 The biggest challenge was to safely move
        this tank from the owners house to my new house. 2500 lbs glass tank
        move with tight spaces and uneven terrain is a dilemma to solve. For
        about two weeks we had multi companies coming and going to survey the
        site. We also had to hurry up because the owner sold his house and tank
        needed to be moved asap. By late June we went through several riggers
        with no luck / commitment to the job. Finally, we have exhausted all
        resources and needed to make a decision on the company to take this
        task. We have reached out to Team MRC and Raj and his team came through!
        The move was set for July 17th! Here is a quick video of how the tank
        needed to be moved out of the owners house. 1000 gal moving strategy

        mixing station. I have two 200 gallon tanks, one for fresh, one for
        salt. This way I always have 400 gallons on hand in case I need to do a
        100% water change. Its been needed twice in since I set the tank up.
        Better to be prepared with systems this size. Yea I'd love to have more
        water as reserve, space is some what limited. I need to think about this
        some more. I do plan to use another 100 gallon tank for extra water
        storage with helping of water changes. Total maximum water changes could
        be 270 gallons at a time.

        came out to get the tank out of the house. Unfortunately we didn't have
        enough people to move it up and out, so 8 of us were able to just get
        the tank/ stand and sump out and rescheduled the move up the hill for
        another day with more people. Here is Tim strategizing how to slide the
        tank down on the dolly.

        Someone's even busy! How have you dealt with the dust from the mud work
        on the drywall? Dust is a bit of an issue during work and when finishing
        drywall. I had to cover tanks with plastic sheets and vacuume out as
        much as I could. Finishing basement it will continue to be a challenge,
        but other than basic methods and taking extra precaution, I don’t see
        any other easy solution. All my sps corals doing great. I have several
        high end acro frags and some larger colonies. I did have some Zoas melt
        over 24 hrs period after water change, which was very strange. However,
        I did read about those particular zoas melt from time to time. It was a
        colony of gobstoppers. Rose bubbletip is huge and looking great. Testing
        water parameters, water changes every week or two and venting out co2
        been my priorities. Carbon helps too During next few days I’m planning
        to relocate 100 gal on the newly-built stand. 1000 gal DT in works

        After finishing plumbing first pump, I found couple small leaks which
        could not be easily fixed. I ended up cutting off some pipes and redoing
        it. Yesterday I turned on pump and run it all night long. Gotta tell
        you, it’s a weird feeling running this much water with new plumbing not
        knowing what you will wake up to. Will it be major flood in the morning?
        Luckily no issues, I did find minor drops here and there, should be easy
        to patch it. Here is what main pump plumbing looks like and after
        running about 9k gallons per hour flow through sump, only thing that
        make sound is water flow within the sump itself. Everything else is
        quite, love dolphin pumps! Following items are on the agenda: 1. Build
        support for plumbing (draining side) 2. Finish plumbing 2nd pump 3.
        Raise refugium 6” higher (build addition support for the base to help
        draining) 4. Finish plumbing water changing system 5. Adding equipment
        to manifold (skimmer, UV, refugium, calcium reactor, denitrification
        reactor, additions two reactors). 6. Acid bath dryrock 7. Aquascape 8.
        Install lights fixture (leds / t12s) 9. Finish framing the tank/ paint
        10. Finish drywall basement/ paint 11. Fill up tank with saltwater
        (cycle begins 4-6months) 12. Test flow, add powerheads 13. Finish
        basement flooring 14. Adding fish 1 month after cycle 15. 4/5/6 months
        triton test (adding corals based on results)

        Flowery Branch, GA • Apr 23, 2019 • • Add bookmark • #88 I bleached my
        rock when I 1st started. From what I've learned since then I won't use
        it again. All it does is turn any organic material white. Back when I
        was using filter socks I found a thread for cleaning them with Sodium
        Percarbonate which is the same chemical in Oxyclean without any
        detergents. When mixed with water in creates hydrogen peroxide H2O2
        which will disintegrate any organics. Combined with a light acid wash,
        if needed, will get the rock a lot cleaner with less PO4 released in the
        new system. Dealer for all brands including, Reef

        cleaning 600lbs of rock Main reason to use bleach for me was that I had
        lots of dead organic material on it and didn’t want to risk bring any
        pests with it as well. Too big of a system to deal with it. I’m going to
        rinsit it off until all smell is gone then aquascape puzzle begins.

        redo some plumbing for skimmer and uv. I have connected both together
        and attached flow meter leader into skimmer. Unfortunately I did not
        take into account that refugium tank water level was lower than uv
        filter. Next day I woke up to a flooded fishroom. About 30 gallons on
        the floor. I had to build another support to raise 11 inches for
        refugium tank and redo som more plumbing. Between refugium a mixing
        tank, sump, uv filter and skimmer, I am currently cycling about 500
        gallons of water. Display tank is still empty. My plan is to design an
        aquascape then fill it up with water. At the moment, I’m trying
        different ideas of rock work. I will take my time with this to my full
        satisfaction. This is the most fun / creative part of the build and I
        gotta get it right... Some ideas so far

        project was to pair all 17 devices to two wxm modules. I have to say
        process isn’t easy. I need to pair 13 Radion and 4 mp60s. I keep getting
        conflicts between devices. I read about this and found out I have to
        unplug other devices and do one module at a time. I do have onelink
        module but don’t want to use it. Once WXM set up it should all work my
        easier. I will try to pair it all tonight.

        <br /> • May 14, 2019 Day 3 filling up the tank. I’m thinking 2-3 more
        days until it’s filled up. Water volume after rock mass taken out is
        about 970 us gallons in the main display tank then need to add another
        75 gallons refugium, 100 gallons water changing tank about 75 gallons
        between skimmer and uv filter. Refugium is roughly 380 gallons filled up
        to the top, so I’m projecting about 200 gallons of water when
        operational. RODI unit makes 200 gallons every 24 hours. Add all that up
        maybe 3-4 more days of making water.

        added 100 mexican turbo snails and they took care of most diatoms
        problem. I’ve noticed that aptasia eating filefish has a taste for
        snails antennas. Because it’s so many of them it should be okay, time
        will tell. I have added 50gallons ATO reservoir to the main system,
        which should last me for 5-7 days. Daily evaporation is about 7-10
        gallons. Up next I’m planning to add small grow out frag tank to the
        system, 24x12x12 30 gallons. Also I took down two qts 40 and 38 gallon
        and replaced it with one larger QT tank 120gal. Currently I have 12
        yellow tangs waiting to go through quarantine period before adding them
        to main display. More fishes to come.

        Ive added 55gallon barrel for ATO. The water evaporation rate is about
        10 gallons per day. 2nd I’ve built stand an additional stand for frag
        tank and couple of reactors. Grow out frag tank is 48x 12x 12 Plumbing
        was finished and all my free space is now taken. Lights and power heads
        for frag tank should arrive in the next few days. 3rd I have finished
        connecting calcium reactor and 20lbs Co2 tank and now I’m need to tune
        it up. I started with 1 bubble per sec and 1 drip per second rate. Also
        I have removed my QT tanks and replaced it with 120. I set it up as a
        separate QT system for soft and LPs corals along with bubble tip
        anemones. As far as some addition to the live stock. I have 10 yellow
        tangs in qt waiting to be put in the big tank. Also 1 tomini tang about
        4” and tomorrow I’m picking up 5-6” blue tang with 3-4” golden flake
        angel.

        that's a lot of fish! How many more are you planning? Currently it’s
        about 70-80 fish in the tank. I may add few more big fish in a little
        while, but I want to wait a bit before I do that. I was thinking Blonde
        Naso, Chevron, Achilles, Blue Caribbean, Sohal and Vlamingii tangs Some
        more pajama cardinalfish. In another 6 to 12 months bunch of Anthias,
        but I want to wait for Anthias because I always had bad luck with them.
        I need to set up auto feeder for 3-4 times a day and make sure it works
        flawlessly before Anthias would go in. Last time I had Anthias, I only
        feed them 2 times a days, then they stopped eating all together and
        starved to death. Nothing I could do at that point. It was terrible to
        watch over a month period and they all slowly died one by one total of
        16 of them. They left me with very bad taste about Anthias and their
        eating habits. —- A few updates on the tank here: Tank is maturing well,
        71 days up and running. I did 2nd small water change, about 170 gallons.
        Tested water Alk is at 7.5 (Hannah) I also sent out ICP test to Triton.
        They just received it Friday so I should be getting back results in a
        few days —- I have started slowly adding frags of sticks into frag tank.
        It’s about a week. Good coloration and polyps are out. I will be adding
        some more frags today. Here are few shots of current frags... As for
        algae control, I’m planning to put several Mollys here. Currently I’m
        working on finishing acclimation for these two mollys Salinity in this
        14gal cube is at 31, goal is to make it 35 by the end of the week. I
        went from zero to 31 in about 10 days. I’m also thinking about adding
        some zoas into frag tank. I’ll sit on that and think about how I want it
        to look this week. As far as hardware updates, I had to relocate one of
        the ductwork to vent from the back of the tank. That made temperature to
        be much more stable. It went from ranging 78.5 to 77.2 over weeks
        period, to 77.7 to 77.2 over three days period. Before After ductwork
        adjustment, I marked day of installation with x Also I have ordered
        backup generator, it’s going to be delivered and installed in the next
        two weeks. 22kw generator 200amp generac Slowly finishing basement
        drywall and flooring next.

        into your main system make sure you use a coral QT and pull the frags
        off the plugs they come on before dipping then mount them on new plugs
        before putting them into the QT. I don't know if you did that on the
        ones in the pics above. It looks like there's coraline and algae on the
        plugs. Things like Aiptasia, Vermetid snails and certain algae's like
        Bryopsis & RTA will be a massive PITA for you if they get into the main
        system. I've learned my lessons on my current system and the new one I
        do will have a very strict QT process. I'm going to have to cook a all
        of my rock to get rid of RTA & Vermetids. All the corals I keep from
        that system will even be QT'd for several months too. Don't take any
        frag for granted no matter where or who it comes from. All it takes is
        one lapse in judgement and you'll have a big problem on your hands in 6
        months to a year.

        One thing I’m still doing multiple time per day is alkalinity testing. I
        have always thought that with so much water alkalinity will be more
        stable. Man was I wrong... Testing it 2-4 times per it still jumping up
        and down, after tunning calcium reactor. It ranges from 7.2 to 8 Calcium
        reactor is dropping at about 3 gallons per hour speed. Wild stuff, I’m
        guessing all the coraline algue growth is consuming all that calcium and
        alkalinity, along with other bacteria growth. Tank is growing and eating

        amazing. I really need to get out there to see it. Stop by anytime this
        week, I’m working on finishing basement. I’m very excited, I’ve place on
        order for Reefbot (a birthday gift to myself) I wonder how quickly I’ll
        get it. Also I had to catch filefish and place it in refugium. Turns out
        it was eating my zoas and started picking at LPS corals too. Originally
        I thought it may have been angelfish but I was him going at my hammer
        and zoas today. Took me good 3-4 hours to catch him...

        planning to test for with reefbot. (8 vials for test reagents) RS -
        phosphates (2 vials) I’ll be testing phosphates once per day for a month
        to see the trend. RS - alkalinity (1 vial) Since I’m running calcium
        reactor I will be testing 4 times per day for the first two weeks. Then
        I’m planning to scale it down to 2 times per day based on stability.
        Tropic Marin - Nitrates (3 vials) Once per day for a month to see the
        trend. API - calcium (2 vials) Once per day for first two weeks, then I
        may scale it down to once every three days. Magnesium testing manually
        once per week. Since I have elevated levels I’m not worried about it for
        a while... Current level is at 1530 ppm

        did some more plumbing work and now 100 gallons tank and 60 gallons cube
        both connected to one main system. Total water volume at about 1500
        gallons. Plan is to have all my softies and anemones in the cube. Here
        is a picture in blue lights It’s a bit overstocked ... I put a little
        bit of a sand in the cube just in case I accidentally get a wrasse or
        two Here is a picture of cube with all lights on My plan for 100 gallons
        to be mainly LPS and zoa tank. It’s kinda empty at the moment, I’ll
        upload few more pictures of plumbing work and the tank it self. As far
        as display goes, everything looking good. I have a few more sps frag to

        phosphates issues lately, lots of hair algae popping out in frag tank.
        So measurement had to be taken. I’ve tested water and nitrates were
        around 12, which is not bad, a bit higher than what I’m aiming for. I
        want it to be around 10 mark. It’s a pain in the but to do accurate
        phosphates test with ultra low Hanna checker, simply because the reagent
        powder is hard to empty out completely without spilling some of it out.
        But practice makes it perfect. As I was doing multiple daily tests
        throughout the week, results became more accurate Anyways I am dosing
        lanthanum chloride solution to lower phosphates I gotta tell you, I have
        done a bit of a research before committing to test this product and see
        how effective this will be for my system. I will advise others to be
        very careful and do your research before trying lanthanum chloride.
        Things to keep in mind, DO NOT lower phosphate level more than .5ppm in
        short period of time (24 hours period) (High risk of coral bleaching)
        Solutions that worked for me is 250ml of RO water to 1ml of lanthanum
        chloride Here is how I dosed and my results in the last 7 days Day1. (2
        tests) Phos- 0.03ppm Pho’s-0.08ppm Dosing 5ml of diluted solution into
        1500gallons of water volume Day2 Phos-0.23ppm (I’m guessing my first two
        tests were not accurate) Dosing 10ml of diluted lanthanum chloride Day3
        Phos-0.04ppm Dosing 10ml Day4 Phos-0.08ppm Dosing 12ml Day5 Phos-0.08ppm
        Dosing 10ml Day6 Phos-0.14ppm Dosing 15ml Day7 (today) Phos-0.06ppm
        Dosing 5ml solution I will test 2nd time later this evening and see
        where we at. Thing to note: I have kept up with heavy feeding of fish.
        But I did adjust skimmer from dry skimming to wet skimming.

        evening folks! Wanted to give some updates here. First, I’m continue to
        monitor effects of lanthanum chloride as well a stump remover for which
        I started to dose regularly to bring nitrates up. I will share data in a
        week or two of the progress... Other update: Reefbot! I have received
        and set up reefbot. I have to say directions on the setup and almost
        non-existent. Most of it I had to figure out myself by watching videos
        etc... The company needs to put a bit more effort of making videos on
        set up. Biggest challenge was that I had to exit out of app during the
        initial set up and after turning back on there was no way to get back
        into step by step directions. My reefbot was telling me that it was
        already register to account and would not let me do anything. After
        several tickets and couple of days messing around with unit I finally
        figured out how and what needed to be done. Having said that, I’m super
        happy with automation that reefbot brings. I’m thinking, I may create
        video for how to set up the unit and what things to look for during the
        process to help other out there... Currently I’m testing nitrate ,
        alkalinity, phosphates and calcium with this unit. Here is what I found
        out, Hanna check for alkalinity was giving me consistent results however
        it’s about 1.5dkh off from Red Sea tester. I’ve used three different
        Hannah tester with 3 different reagents and similar results. Hanna check
        would show me alk at 8.2- 8.8 dkh , Red Sea Pro would show me 9.8 - 10.3
        dkh I have ordered salifert test kit and looking forward on getting
        results and comparing. For now I’m focusing on stability. I’ve lowered
        drip of calcium reactor and keeping my alkalinity at 9 by Red Sea pro
        test kit. Phosphates are between 0.02 - 0.04 I am still doing fine
        tuning of dosing lanthanum chloride . Also with stump remover I’m doing
        about 3 table spoons daily to raise nitrates to 10ppm Currently at 5ppm
        Also feeding habits are about the same, 2-3 times per day with heavy
        pellets and frozen food. Live stock update: I’ve added gold torch to
        display tank, good size cc 21 tail torch frag. Beautiful color on that,
        hard to take picture to capture it. I’ll try to figure it out and share.
        I’ve also added lots of acro frags to display tank and everything
        looking good so far. Walt Disney frag from last year turned into mini
        colony, same as joe knows rainbow and fox flame. Here are few pictures

        <br /> • Oct 6, 2019 • • Add bookmark • #167 So today I was ready to
        finish up tiles flooring. When I walked in the fish room, I’ve noticed
        small water spots near pumps. I took out temporary raised floor covers
        and started cleaning up. After water clean up, I have looked everywhere
        for the source of leak but no luck. I’m stumped where this leak came
        from, water in the system is leveled and ato isn’t going crazy with
        beeping. Now I’m trying to think what I did in the last couple of day
        that may have spilled some water on the floor. I moved few corals
        yesterday from frag tank to main display and changed filter socks but
        that’s about it. after some more investigation I found tiny drip from
        skimmer fitting. I did turn on skimmer yesterday as well after being off
        for a few weeks. Was raising nitrates in the tank and now its between
        10-20 somewhere. The skimmer is about 5 feet away from where spots of
        water were found. I guess it maybe have dripped in to lowest point of
        the floor over time. I will be keeping close eye on things here today to
        see if there are any more leaks. Ah just found the source of leak, in
        the skimmer fitter where water lever adjusted.

        ridiculously effective... I’ve been trying to raise my nitrates for
        almost a month now. I was at 5ppm with goal to get to 10 Feeding fish
        3-4 times a day heavy on dry pellets and nori sheets. Once 2-3 days
        frozen food. About a week ago started putting in 2 1/2 table spoons of
        stump remover daily. Meanwhile skimmer been offline for about a month
        now. Two days ago I tested nitrates and it was at 20ppm. So I turned on
        the skimmer to lower it. Next day I had about 5 gallons of waste to get
        rid of. Tonight I decided to test for nitrates again and I’m back at
        5ppm Here is a history of tests. Dmitri Well-Known Member Market

        incredible. I hope you get the leak figured out. If it's a real slow
        leak salt creep should seal it in a week or so. Couple of questions. How
        has the pH been, especially when the skimmer has been off? Is there a
        reason you're shooting for exactly 10 nitrates? I've always approached
        it as 10 was the max and anything between 2-10 was good, but 5 was the
        sweet spot. Click to expand... Thanks Adam! Ph has been between 7.8 -7.9
        I’ve got a lot of surface agitation, I think that helps with keeping up
        ph. Also I circulate fresh air from outside at night time. But when I
        run slimmer ph definitely goes up higher. As far as nitrate go, I
        shooting for somewhere in the range of 10 to 15. I’ve been having a lot
        more success with growth and coloration when it’s higher. I’ve also
        noticed algae isn’t as much of issue (hair algae) when it comes to
        keeping nitrates higher. Another reason is, when I’m looking for ratio
        between phosphates and nitrates to be about 1 to 17 Having higher
        phosphates it seems to be easier to increase nitrates rather than battle
        phosphates so much to keep those at lower level. It’s all constant,
        trial and error, one giant experiment figuring out what works best Adam

        experiment figuring out what works best That's the same issue I had with
        my system in the basement. When I was dosing 2-part and using Sodium
        Hydroxide for the Alk it was real easy to keep the pH between 8.1 & 8.2.
        As soon as I put the CARX on line that went out the window. With the
        skimmer running 24/7 and a co2 scrubber connected closed loop the pH
        would be what your seeing. When I added two gallons of kalk a day it
        would hold 7.95~8.05 till the media needed replacing in the scrubber. I
        could see the drop starting and knew when the media was getting
        exhausted. In the new house, the systems will be in the basement again,
        it's unfinished like yours was. The new fish room is going to be
        28'x16.5' so I'm going to have plenty of space this time, instead of the
        cramped closet I'm coming from. The first thing I'm going to tackle down
        there is the electrical & HVAC. I'm also going to put in a HRV Air
        Exchanger. I'm hoping the constant fresh air is going to be a big help.
        Another thing I'm going to do is experiment with different ways to blow
        off the co2 from the effluent out of the CARX before it goes into the
        system. My goal is to keep a min pH of 8.1. I've read a good bit on the
        Redfield Ratio. Some well respected names, like RHF, say it's a moot
        point. While others swear by it anecdotally. It's going to be
        interesting to follow your results over the long term. Did you have any
        new tank ugly's with your main tank at the 8-12 week mark? Dmitri

        basement and tank mature to 6 -12 months Coraline algae is growing
        everywhere and should help with getting rid of co2 during day time.
        currently I’m running slimmer just night time hours which helps with
        balancing ph abit more. My main concern is to get nitrates to be around
        10-15 ppm area because of phosphate issues. As far as uglies that was
        one of the main issues so far, not getting nitrates high fast enough
        where phosphates were out of balance. So I had hair algae issue in my
        frag tank and lost few frags to that. No issues in the main tank.
        Feeding heavy and corals growing well. There was a pump issue during
        backup generator installation. One of the return pumps gave out, luckily
        I had a spare one and replaced it. I’m looking to upgrade both dolphin
        pumps to new MRC pumps, which would save me around 300kwh of energy I

        <br /> Dallas • Dec 15, 2019 • • Add bookmark • #182 I had a few upgrade
        over last few weeks that I wanted to share. First Tank just turned 7
        months old, maturing well. ORP has been rising, ph has been steady and
        temperature well controlled Nitrates have been around 10ppm mark (I’m
        testing twice per week up from once a week, to make sure it’s steady)
        Phosphates been steady at 0.04ppm (Testing once a week) Calcium I
        haven’t tested in over a month. Guessing it’s still at 500 mark, being
        that I’m running cal reactor. Magnesium I haven’t tested in a month as
        well, same reason as Cal. Probably 1600 mark. Reefbot has been working
        well. I have relocated to its new place where its been connected to
        permanent drain. Some additional plumbing needed to be done. Ive got
        some new pets: gem / naso and really scopas tang (it has interesting
        coloration, more which than average scopas) All three are in QT, eating
        well. I’m waiting to get copperband butterfly fish and a unicorn tang.
        Then I’ll put them all in together into main display and cross my
        fingers. I have added automatic neck cleaner for the slimmer and next
        need to plumb it to the drain- waste for automatic wash down system I
        started to grow phytoplankton but first batch did not do well. I’m
        guessing it’s because either jug wasn’t sterilized. I’m looking to
        restart with a new culture in the next few days.

        Dallas • Dec 29, 2019 • • Add bookmark • #183 Yesterday I was cleaning
        but cup with automatic wash down. The process is I turn on freshwater
        valve and it just drains all the stuff out of the cup into the drain.
        However I decided to close the drain just so I can fill it up a bit and
        then flush it all down. So I set down and dose off staring at the tank,
        few minutes later I heard water sound overflowing my slimmer.... Im not
        really sure how much fresh water was dumped into the system but I
        drained everything down quickly My ATO did not set off sound so it’s
        definitely less than 5 gallons. Having 1500 gallons of system volume
        definitely helps but I’m still worried I’m about negative affects of

        Thanks for tagging along @sidvicious ! I look forward to this think to
        grow. lately I’ve been having challenges with some new frags fading out.
        I think it’s because of transition from one system to another. I gotta
        figure out a better way of acclimating new frags. yesterday I put
        together 65 gallon separate system that I would be doing full triton
        method on. For now it will be anemones tank. I need to get rid of some
        of them, too many bubble tips and even rainbow one split in the main
        display. (I’m keeping a close eye on it)

        update and question for anyone who may know: I have recently changed
        media in calcium reactor. I’m using 3x 1gal CaribSea -ARM REACTOR MEDIA
        - EXTRA COARSE and Two Little Fishies 1KG REMAG - MAGNESIUM MEDIA FOR
        CALCIUM REACTORS. Ever since I changed media, I’m struggling keeping up
        with alkalinity. At this point I have open reactor water running through
        it at maximum drop rate and alkalinity is 7.8 My goal it to get it up to
        8.5 maybe 9 I was wondering, if I get some urchins to get rid of
        coraline algae, would that help increase alkalinity? Has anyone tried
        that before? I really don’t want to set up another calcium reactor but
        if this doesn’t work I may have no choice. Dmitri Well-Known Member

        Geo 618 and I had a smaller chamber with extra fine media. I didn't have
        an issue keeping my Alk above 8.5 but I wasn't using it as the sole
        component for Alk & Cal, I had a kalk reactor running with a DOS pump
        putting exact metered amounts which got me up to 9dkh. That really
        helped with getting the system pH up. I've seen conflicting
        recommendations with regard to the type of media to use. I too have seen
        the most popular recommendation to use what we did but also several
        saying to use fine media in the main chamber too. It does make sense
        that the finer media has a lot more surface area. I'd ask you, what is
        your flow rate for the effluent and what is the pH you've set the
        reactor to? Have you tested the effluent to see what's in it? I haven’t
        tested that water out of calcium reactor yet. I will do it tonight
        though. Ph is between 6.5-6.75 I kinda wish I went with smaller media
        now.

        Ya ph is stable but I think I’m at its limit for how much ALK it can put
        out with this large type of media. Adam, what do you think of urchin
        idea to get rid of coroline algae. Think it will help raise Alkalinity?

        what do you think of urchin idea to get rid of coroline algae. Think it
        will help raise Alkalinity? Urchins are indiscriminate but they will eat
        what they have a taste for. If they're not in the mood for coraline and
        there's something else that's what they'll eat. When it is coraline they
        will leave bare swaths striped down to the rock. You'd need several with
        a tank your size. Also if a coral is not secured good they will knock it
        over. In the case of pincushions, they will pickup anything not glued
        down and carry it all over the tank. Often depositing it somewhere
        unseen or hard to reach. Sucks when it's a high dollar frag. If you had
        a cheap birdsnest frag sitting next to a $200 acro frag which one do you
        think will disappear? lol, have fun hunting for that acro... You have
        plenty of room to lower the pH in the reactor still. Do you know what
        the tanks Alk demand is? You'll also need to know the Alk of the
        effluent to know what it's putting in the system. There are many ways to
        skin this cat. Regardless I think that flow rate is quite high. If it's
        really 10gal/hr that's 631ml/min. I'd be interested to see what the
        effluent Alk is at this rate and what it is at a quarter that rate,
        maybe even 1/6th of that rate. It would take a few days to get those
        test results because you'd need a day to let things settle out in the
        reactor after making a change. Once you know what the demand of the tank
        is you'll know what you need to replace. Then it's what is the reactor
        putting out and making adjustments as needed. The thread from acroholic
        I linked has a lot of good info in it. So do those BRS videos. Have you
        considered using Kalk at all? I'm planning on using this method, or
        possibly a version of it, when my new system is ready.

        <br /> Dallas • Feb 13, 2020 • • Add bookmark • #200 I’ve got some
        updates to share. 1st I have installed kalkwasser reactor and doing
        small doses to start of 200ml 16 times per day I may increase it later
        on as I’m monitoring alkalinity. I have not changed calcium reactor flow
        so this is just a boost. So far alkalinity is at 8.5-8.6 Trying to get
        to 9 at some point. PH went up by about 0.02 and peaks at 8.12 kalk
        reactor hold 3 gallons of water where I put 1.5 cups of media. I’m
        hoping that mixer can handle this where I won’t have to redo it. My
        first time I put 2.5 cups and magnetic stirrer couldn’t handle it. My
        idea behind 1.5 cups is that it would last me 2 weeks before I have to
        mix more. 2nd update, I finally added copperband to the system after
        month of QT. At first, powderblue was a bully for a day or so. Now
        everything seem to be in order and happy fishes (Hard to get good

        near disaster happened today I was monitoring my calcium pro for calcium
        reactor and noticed something unusual happening. 24hr chart I came to
        check it out and couldn’t see anything unusual. At first I thought co2
        tank was running low, but pressure gage was good. Then I started to hear
        weird noise, didn’t know what it was. Looking around I suddenly realized
        that noise was coming from pump for calcium reactor and the reactor
        itself was empty. Damn! I was freaking out, how is that possible ?! I
        looked in the sump expecting to see no water but in the back of my mind
        I knew everything was working flawlessly so it couldn’t be lack of
        water. So how my water valve that is connected to frag tank and calcium
        reactor wasn’t blocked. Mind you it hasn’t been adjusted since 11 months
        ago when I set up the system. Anyways it’s still a mystery to me, I
        adjusted the valve and now water was flowing/ filling up reactor. I
        realized too that when I was adjusting water valve from reactor that too
        was not letting water out. So I opened it too, lots of co2 gas came out
        when I opened that valve. 2nd thing happened my inline check valve
        failed for kalk reactor I looked at it and kalk reactor was 1/2 empty.
        Another shocker... where did the water go? I took out online check valve
        and start blowing air init to test it, sure enough it was goin in from
        both side. So about 1 1/2 gallons of kalk water was put back into ato
        topoff 55gallon barrel (I wasn’t sure how it will affect system) okay at
        this point Im alk fortunately it only went up from 9.5 to 9.8 I think if
        I was to let it go for couple of days not noticing it. Alk would
        probably drop big time and could potentially crash tank. Also that
        calcium pump would have burned out running on empty. I think I will have
        to replace ph probe in the reactor but over all near disaster avoided!
        What are the odds of calcium reactor, kalkwasser reactor failure on the
        same day? Crazy stuff...

        #244 civics14 said: interesting that your lanthanum reading is that low
        since you dose it to reduce phosphates. looks like it get bound up right
        away and removed. how often do you change your socks while dosing
        lanthanum? are you dripping? socks are pain ... I remove them every 2-3
        days which isn’t ideal but I can’t do daily, just too much work. I do
        200 micros on two sides and 2 10 micros in the middle. This lets me get
        away with changing that way. I still have to deal with tons of socks
        washing every two weeks or so. It took me a while to dial in on
        lanthanum, I was doing very low dosing before, but now with this formula
        it really make different. As far as feeding habits, I have not made any
        changes. Feeding ton of food. Every 1.5 hour, two rounds of small
        pellets. From 9am to 9pm Every other day, diy reef chili and 4 sheets of

        <br /> • Aug 24, 2020 • • Add bookmark • #246 I got lazy and have not
        tested alkalinity in 7 days. Yesterday I tested and it dropped to 6.1
        dkh, I had to use seachem buffer (12 tablespoons) tested today and it’s
        6.7. Did another 12 tablespoons just now. I am wondering why my
        alkalinity dropped so much over a period of 1 week. Usually it was in
        the range of 7.4-7.8. Only thing different I did was start to dose heavy
        lanthanum. My guess is after phosphates were removed uptake of
        alkalinity increased. I also suspect that maybe calcium reactor probe
        isn’t correctly read ph. I lower ph to 5.9 from 6.3 to see if it will
        make any difference. Finally I have fixed actuator on reefbot and
        testing water won’t be an issue anymore. Currently running alk/
        phosphates / magnesium and nitrates tests. I will probably do alkalinity
        test 2 times a day and phosphates once per day to get it tunned. I will
        be changing calcium reactor media to triton media, I wonder if it will
        give me boost to alkalinity.

        Oh... thats risky. Not sure I would risk it if they aren’t bothering
        anything. I actually wanted more asterinas cause I always wanted
        harlequins. I did end up getting 2 harlequin shrimp but not seeing
        impact on the population of starfish just yet. The pair of harlequins
        are pretty large too about 1 1/2” each. Both have been in the display
        tank for about a week now. As far as blue linckia, i put it in the 60
        cube safe from harlequins. Small update today, I’ve set up doser for two
        part on top of Carx and Kalkwasser. I made DIY 5 gallon containers out
        of buckets and starting dosing with 100ml per day to see how it goes.
        Currently I’m sitting at 7.6dkh, goal is 9 My nitrates jumped from 0-5
        to 10-20 since I’ve stopped changing socks and lowered skimmer. I think
        I will keep it around that area. Phosphates been an uphill battle,
        dosing 80ml lanthanum daily on top of GFO reactor. Formulate for
        lanthanum that I use is this: 1500ml water to 48ml lanthanum Currently
        I’m at 0.34ppm it jumped from 0.02 after I changed gfo and only had
        enough for about 1/2 of reactor size. I am planning to set up DOS today

        pounds of chaeto to see any positive effects. Are you running an ATS? If
        not I HIGHLY suggest you do so on a tank that large. Once making that
        switch I have no more high PO4’s, etc. worth their weight in gold for
        big systems. Small systems too. Let me know we can talk more about it on
        the phone. You and Adam recommend ATS, I’m gonna have to look into it.

        two h380s. Meanwhile I’ve ordered smaller ones, two of h160. Should be
        good enough for the size of 75gallon refugium. Second, I’ve ordered four
        these cheaper lights on amazon for DIY project (algae scrubber) I’m
        hoping these works out well, I may build 2-3 more. Meanwhile I’ve been
        dosing lanthanum manually but I want set up drip system of lanthanum
        right into skimmer. Still figuring out logistics of that.

        <br /> • Nov 11, 2020 • • Add bookmark • #292 For the last couple of
        months I’ve been battling phosphates issue and forgot about nitrates. My
        nitrates were always between 10-20 so Ive stopped testing for about a
        month. All this algae issues I was having, my thoughts were it’s
        definitely phosphates. Stupid assumptions and no testing cost me dearly.
        Four days ago I’ve decided to test out this new Hannah nitrates kit.
        Prior to this test I was using reefbot for nitrates with Red Sea kit.
        Results would come at 20ppm, I didn’t think much of it. Anyways I did
        Hannah nitrates test and it came over 50ppm. So I tested two more times
        thinking it was an error. Same result... At this point I realized that
        this was main main issue why a lot of my coral were browning out.. First
        thing I did was massive water change. Unfortunately having 1400 gallons
        system and 200 gallons premix salt, water changes were limited. Over the
        next 48 hours i did around 409 gallons change. While doing these water
        changes I looked around to see what could possible be the source of
        these nitrates and phosphates, after all skimmer is running wet and full
        power, additionally have refugium, algae reactor and a scrubber. I
        couldn’t figure it out, all my tank are bare bottom. So while doing
        water changes in refugium I was doing some cleaning. On the bottom of
        refugium (75 gallon tank) very little flow, all detritus was settling in
        over last 17 months. I never cleaned it once... There was about 1” thick
        layer of detritus. When I started vacuuming it was clear to me that this
        was the source of all problems with phosphates and nitrates. it’s been
        about 24 hours since I vacuumed it. In addition to water changes I’ve
        set up another reactor, sulfur reactor. Hope after this nitrates will
        never be a problem again. I‘ve been dosing vodka to combat nutrients
        also, I’m on week 6 of doing. Upto 16.2ml per day My tank has been
        running for almost 19months now, fighting nutrients has been the biggest
        challenge so far. One thing for sure, with big systems unless you have
        huge amount of water on hand ready for emergency water change, very hard
        to flatten the curve. It’s like a freight train.. In the near future I’m
        planning to invest in 6-700 gallon wall/water tank for the emergencies
        purpose. little bit of vacuuming left to do here, this picture is after
        I vacuumed 1” thick of detritus from the refugium. Here is a picture of
        calcium / gfo and a newest addition sulfur reactor that I could fit all
        together side by side. There isn’t much space left here. Here are some
        pictures of casualties. I do hope some of these colonies will recover.
        Most expensive corals seems to always die first... Currently phosphates
        are at 0.06ppm Nitrates last test was at 50ppm. I’ll be doing one more
        water change of 75gal to clean refugium completely out then test again.

        experiance notes, careful with the vodka amounts. I was chasing lowing
        phosphates and ended up having to dose nitrate to feed the bacteria
        enough to finish off the phosphate and dosing a LOT of vodka. I had a
        bryopsis and was trying everything to kill it. I ended up with bacterial
        blooms that would clog everything up. And no change in algea since it
        was feeding off what was leaching out of rocks. Id recommend using the
        vodka to lower the numbers but try to utilize other stuff to keep them
        down. Just something to think about. Thanks, good info. I’m trying to
        balance it between that and ATS/ chaeto. Eventually, I want to stop
        using GFO and just rely on ATS and vodka/ skimmer. Currently my
        phosphates are being on the lower end where nitrates seems to be the
        problem. As soon as I get nitrates down to about 10ppm, I’ll try to take
        gfo offline and control nitrates/ phosphates with balancing vodka and
        algae reactor etc.. I can’t grow much algae because of limited
        phosphates at the moment. However if I let my phosphates go just a
        little bit, because of high nitrates algae grows crazy all over.

        Here is what I’m planning for this year. 1. I need to redo aquascape on
        my tank. What I would like is to create a floating reef with nothing
        touching bottom glass. This will require some interesting shelves that
        would be mounted on the back of the tank. Logistics needs to be figured
        out. One main reason for doing this besides how cool 8-900lbs of rock
        floating is getting rid off an detritus and dead spots that collect it.
        2. I am planning to add sand filter. Tired of dealing with filtersocks.
        Logistics of installing it needs to be worked out. Idea is to install
        1000gallon barrel in the garage where fresh water will be stored.
        Plumbing it to sand filter for flashing out / cleaning periodically.
        Just like they do with swimming pools. Then once it’s cleaned out
        reconnecting to the mai filtration system of the tank. I would like to
        get some assistance from someone who has done that on public aquariums
        or swimming pools before. Any recommendations/ tips would be
        appreciated! 3. Need to built and install ATS, I’ve been borrowing one
        from a friend and love how its working so far. Cheers and looking
        forward to more updates ! Dmitri Well-Known Member Market Messages 645

        <br /> • Mar 7, 2021 • • Add bookmark • #319 Well I just had a true
        disaster happened with tank. One of the unions started to leak so I
        decided to tighten it and ended up breaking union in main manifold. Now
        I did think it’s possible to do that so I did not take step precautions
        steps like turning off one of the pumps and shutting part of the
        manifold off... two main pumps it’s about 8-10k gallons of water per
        hour pressure. So much splashing water comes out.. I immediately turned
        off main valve and shut off on the pumps. I then cut off the pipe and
        cap sealed the manifold part. Anyways in two years I have never turned
        off main part of the tank manifold, so all water that was going to the
        one side of the tank was redirected to other side and everywhere else.
        After I finished sealing I’ve looked at my reactors and both calcium
        reactors were leaking from all the water pressure. Fixing that was as
        big of a deal but that’s definitely the down side of having manifold.
        When one thing is adjusted, everything had to be adjusted as well.
        running my tank on one pump at the moment while cap is curing over
        night... crazy crazy plumbing ... glad I didn’t get electrocuted with
        all that water splashing. the water pressure was almost as bad as this

        <br /> Dallas • Apr 10, 2021 • • Add bookmark • #337 So little bit of
        progress here. I did glue both sides to 90 elbow pvc, however it did not
        go as planned. The angle and work space was so tight, being 2” schedule
        80 it was hard to push the pipes in all the way. I think it went in
        about .25” before it was not moving any more. I hope it won’t leak. I
        will be testing it once it’s all fully connected. worst case scenario
        would be, I’d have to cut both out and then put them together with
        Union. fingers crossed... 1000 gallons barrel been filling up slowly for
        3 days about 600 so far in it. I will connect dc12000 to it for mixing
        salt. Hope it’s not gonna be too weak to mix it. Other than that, not
        much progress. I haven’t started building new aquascape yet, but already
        have everything needed. Two days ago I took covid shot (moderna vaccine)
        that think knocked me out... Been out of commission for two days with
        headache and my arm was hurting too. Today day three, feeling much
        better. Back to work... Dmitri Well-Known Member Market Messages 645

        about half way done with plumbing. Yesterday I finished first part and
        connected main 1000 gallon barrel from garage to 200 gallon mixing
        station in the basement. There were lots of challenges running pipes and
        connecting them with tight spaces in between. Mainly because 2” pipes
        are a pain in the butt. I actually had to redo corner fitting and
        replace pvc pipe with flex pvc. I’ve also connected main barrel to the
        drain just in case. Very tight space under the stairs. After doing that
        job was like doing an advanced yoga class. You should have see me doing
        these flips and bending backwards just to get in there... Yesterday I
        tested water lines, no leaks. It takes about 16.5 minutes to fill up 170
        gallons from upstairs. That was just gravity test, up next I’ll be
        testing it with a pump. What’s left to plumb is next part which will
        connect directly into the sump. Here is a happy selfie of job done,
        don’t want to go back there again... Adam Trustee Staff member Sponsor

        bookmark • #358 So I was on vacation for 5 days, out of town. I set up
        everything on cruise control with apex, or so I thought... 2nd day out,
        Monday evening we have power surge. My system tells me one of the
        Neptune energy bars went offline and then come back with no voltage to
        it. Of course, it happened to be most critical energy bar. ATO connected
        to that, RO refill connected to that and I made a mistake to put both
        dozers from two calcium reactors also connected to that energy bar. Now
        I’ve been monitoring and calculating what would happened in the next 3
        days and looks like my alkalinity is dropping at the rate of .5 dkh per
        day without calcium reactor dosing. It went from 9.5dkh to about 7 dkh
        when I will be back home tonight. Currently at 7.8dkh I’m thinking of
        using buffer to get it upto 7.5dkh when I get home and then reconnecting
        both calcium reactors with same dosing as before. Additionally I’m
        planning to do small water change and increasing alkalinity testing from
        4 times per day to maybe 8 times until I find good spot for drip rate
        with alk. My goal is to increase alk to about 8.5 over 1 week period.
        Also I’m removing kamoer pumps from apex and putting them on battery
        backup power strip that’s always on. Another thing I’m going to add is
        2ndary ATO as fail safe. Split ATOs between two different energy bars.
        One thing I don’t understand if how it fail, new energy bar. Maybe fuse
        went off. I can still see it on my apex display just says zero voltage
        output. Looking at cameras, seem that ATO hasn’t been working for about
        3 days and water lever dropped. Salinity went up to about 36-36.5ppt And
        RORefill seem to be not working as well. RO reservoir isn’t empty but
        not refilling either. All fish seems to be doing fine. flying in tonight
        and should be home this evening. Dmitri Well-Known Member Market

        @ichthyoid ! I hope it will be okay, alk didn’t drop below 7 yet. From

        going to double up on my tank equipment redundancy. Everything seems to
        be a okay, yesterday I came home and figured out what caused the failure
        of power bar. I had connected power bar to a new smart plug before my
        trip, to verify wattage. Well silly me forgot to program smart plug to
        stay on as default setting. When power tripped that put it to sleep.
        buffer yesterday (8 table spoons) it raised alkalinity by .3dkh but now
        it back down to 7.7 Both calcium reactors been running over night, tank
        is hungry. I’ll use 8 more table spoons Still waiting on lights to come
        on to see how many corals were lost.

        <br /> • May 24, 2021 • • Add bookmark • #365 I found an interesting
        pattern in orp reading: In the morning 9am two auto feeders turn on,
        between next two hours orp will drop 20 units. Lights still off, lights
        comes on 12pm-12am At 11am it seem to be the lowest reading point, it
        goes up from there all the way to any where from 4pm to 6-7pm (20units)
        that’s when I would feed fish heavy (4 nori sheets) ORP drops from that
        point about 20 units again to the lowest reading which usually at 8pm it
        goes up from there all the way to next morning 9am where it peaks and
        drops to repeat the cycle. over all it looks like orp would rise for
        about 15hrs (night time) and drops for about 3 hrs then raises for about
        7-8 hrs then drops for about 1-2hrs Typically 20 units in drop I’m not
        sure what it means exactly but seems that feeding definitely consistent
        with drop in the reading. I guess it’s good to go by this pattern and if
        something unusual will happen it may show up in the reading

        today. I was doing big water change and drained sump for that. When I
        started filling it back up, first baffle that supports socks collapsed
        under water pressure. Luckily it still hold water… gonna have to figure
        out how to fix it, not sure yet. I’ve reach out for some support,

        doesn't look fun. I'd talk to @skriz to see if it can be done in place.
        My guess is that it's possible but going to be very labor intensive. Any
        spot that is going to need glue has to be clean. It would be much easier
        to pull the sump out of service and get it outside for cleaning. If that
        we're done you might as well drive it over to MRC so it can be worked on
        in their shop where they have all the equipment and no travel time for
        their employee(s). If you bring it to them cleaned and dry I'd think
        it'd be the least expensive to fix. I have a 150 gallon stock trough you
        can used for a temp sump while that one is repaired. It's going to need
        to be out of service for a couple days or more I'd think. Once the
        repair is done everything is going to need to be cured before you put
        water in it. We could meet up and swap the trough and my ATS too Ya I
        don’t think moving sump would be an option. I’m planning to use pvc pipe
        and hammer between baffles to space them out how it was. Once it’s in
        original location, even if it leaks, I should be able to use socks
        again. If this works, I may even leave those pipes between baffle in
        that place for that extra support Theoretically this should work, also
        luckily I had 3” diameter pvc cylinder that is long enough to use as a
        force for pvc pipe, as I’m slowly pushing it in Here is what I’m working
        with I’ve decided to turn one pump off and let water fill up the sump so
        I don’t fight against all that water pressure So far I’ve got two pipes
        down one one side. each side is about 8” wide, little more but I’m give
        some buffer space Had to make a whole bunch of cuts, may need some more
        Well I got it in one place now Gonna have to figure out about these
        pipe, make some holes in them or something … Back In Business! Dmitri

        done it this way before and was testing a very large water change
        through the sump. So this may have been the 1st time he's had the whole
        sump empty since it was installed. I actually do something similar on my
        display system but I do not fill it from the drain chamber. I fill in
        the center chamber as well but my sump isn't even 2' tall. Draining it
        completely is about 130ish gallons. I have started just draining
        everything but the two drain chambers of the sump and it's real close to
        100 gallons. This has me rethinking about how I do my changes. My fear
        with Dimitri's situation is that water will seep through the separated
        section at the wall and it's no longer a true weir. It may fill in with
        crap over time but I wouldn't drain it like that again even with the
        piping crossmembers he's put in. Hopefully @skriz will chime in and give
        his long term recommendation. Ya this was kind of careless of me pushing
        that much water so fast without giving it too much thought… sump is
        built to last! Quality for sure. Before this I do remember it had a leak
        between those baffles. That’s probably was a weak point and gave out
        after 2 years I filled up 300 gallons in 5 minutes, that water pressure
        from 2” pipe and how fast it was pushing definitely was too much. Next
        time I’ll be filling it much slower. Sump is without warranty since I
        bought it second hand. I think if I drill few holes in those pipes that
        support each wall, it will be good enough not to cause any problems with
        sulfur. The water flow in that are is pretty crazy so I double anything
        would build up inside those pipes other than sponges and feather
        dusters. Thanks for tagging along!
